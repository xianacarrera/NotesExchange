## Your go-to tool for buying and selling class notes

NotesExchange is a decentralized web application based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows students to buy and sell class notes.

Sudents make money by selling their notes, and their peers save money by buying notes from other students.

Using smart contracts, a student may buy notes from another peer by signing a contract between the two. By pre-defined dates, the second student must provide class notes to the first. If not, the contract assures that its client will receive an agreed remuneration.

Another option is to buy notes that were already taken and were uploaded to a common marketplace. In this case, the contract would be fulfilled in that precise moment, providing access to the notes to the student.
